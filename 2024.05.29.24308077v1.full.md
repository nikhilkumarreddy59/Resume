**Abstract** 

**Background and Objectives:** 

Cough is a common symptom of respiratory diseases and change in the cough sound can reflect a pathological condition in the lungs. Recent advancement on the analysis  of  the cough sound has suggested that it has the potential to be used as a non-invasive marker for screening respiratory conditions, such as Asthma, Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (COPD),  Interstitial  Lung  Disease  (ILD)  and  Bronchiectasis.  The  energy  envelope   is distinguishable  for  normal  subjects  versus   subjects  with   respiratory  conditions.  Peak analysis of the energy envelope helps in quantifying the feature variation for these conditions.  

This study  provides the variation of the peak energy  features** on the Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE) envelope of cough sounds using machine learning tools. Peak properties of energy contours like peak height, peak prominence, base distance (distance between left and right base of a peak) help in quantifying cough patterns.  

**Methods and Materials:** 

Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms to the hospital were recruited to the study. Their cough sounds were recorded through a mobile application. The cough sounds were labeled  with  corresponding  pathologies  from  spirometry.  From  every  subject three audio recordings were collected before taking a spirometry test. Peak analysis is performed on the features extracted from cough audio signals. Peak features are extracted using the function “scipy.signal.find\_peaks” from python’s Scipy library. The comparison of these features are done against the clinical diagnosis which the physician finally arrives at after going through the history, spirometry and radiology as per the standard of practice.**

**Results:** 

The peak analysis in Asthma shows higher base distance and peak height than that of Normal because of prolonged expulsion and airways constriction. The base distance is observed high in Bronchiectasis but peak height and prominence are less when compared with Normal due to loss of elasticity in the airways. Whereas in COPD the base distance and prominence are found to be less than Normal, Asthma and Bronchiectasis which is attributed to multiple narrowing of the glottis. Additionally, the energy peak heights of the cough were observed to be very close due to conditions like excess mucus, airways inflammation, destruction of lung tissue in COPD. 

**Conclusion:** 

Peak analysis of cough provides inferences which can be used as descriptors to differentiate coughs related to respiratory diseases. This study helps us to enhance the performance of Machine Learning models by including the peak energy related features. This peak analysis along with frequency spectral analysis can also be further used in detecting other respiratory conditions.

**Introduction:** 

In recent years, the healthcare industry has seen many innovations in the form of cutting-edge technologies and cutting-edge treatment approaches. Developing predictive and representative health diagnosis systems is essential for continuous monitoring of symptoms to prevent diagnostic mistakes (1). Recently,  focus has shifted to data-driven processes and intelligent software,  where  tools based  on computer-aided detection  (CAD)  and artificial intelligence (AI) are becoming increasingly popular (2). While there is a proven track record of  AI  based algorithms in image-based diagnosis,  voice based diagnosis is  getting  more attention and making significant strides as sounds carry the signature of many diseases (3,4). 

Cough is a common symptom of several respiratory diseases. Any changes in the cough sound can reflect pathological changes in the lungs. In recent years, advancements in

AI  techniques  have  spurred  numerous  studies  aiming  to  categorize  respiratory  diseases through the analysis of cough sound (5). The audio features in cough signals usually contain information about predicament of the respiratory system in different pathological conditions (6). The acoustic analysis of the cough sounds critically detects various respiratory maladies such as COVID-19 (7), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (8), asthma (9-12), pertussis (13,14), croup (15), bronchitis  (16), pediatric pneumonia  (17), lower and upper respiratory  tract  diseases  (18).  Although  numerous  studies  have  illustrated  that  acoustic cough related features can be used to differentiate several respiratory diseases nevertheless, there are only a few correlations between acoustic characteristics and perception ratings. This study aims to quantify the feature variation of various respiratory conditions through the peak analysis of the energy envelope.  

Peak energy analysis involves extracting relevant features from the cough sounds. Chatrzarrin et al., 2011 (19) proposed peaks of the energy envelope and spectral features of the  cough  sound  to  distinguish  wet  and  dry  cough.  This  study  emphasizes  the  energy associated with cough sound peaks as a primary feature for peak analysis. The peak energy can be quantified using techniques like root mean square (RMS) energy calculation. RMS is used to characterize the energy contained in the sound waves of a given cough segment.  

This  is  substantiated  by  the  study  done  by  Ren  et  al.,  2022  (20)  which  showed variations in the mean inter-peak distance in the root mean square energy (RMSE) between COVID – 19 negative and positive patients. Similarly, Ashby et al., 2022 (21) has proposed RMSE peak analysis as a cough audio segmentation framework for COVID detection. The RMSE was computed from the Short-Term Energy (STE), which is the energy of a signal corresponding to the total magnitude of the signal. Further, the peak energy (peak height) calculated from RMS was an important parameter for investigating the relationship between cough sound and physiological measures of cough strength (22). This shows the weightage of the acoustic features both in conventional and machine learning models. A study carried out by Chung et al., 2021 (23) emphasized the role of loudness and energy ratio as the objective characteristic indicator in the acoustic analysis of cough sounds. In the  study, the newly identified characteristics of the cough sound like energy ratio that effectively reflected the acoustic characteristics of pneumonia cough. The accuracy of the ML system to predict the disease by combining the time -domain feature like peak energy with the frequency domain feature is well established in a study conducted by Ismail et al., 2022. The importance of peak energy analysis is well articulated in the study, which implemented it as a part of mixed-

domain feature vector for the quick  identification or early screening of COVID-19 (24). Apart from the identification of pathological cough, the peak energy analysis along with the other time domain and frequency domain features was used to clearly distinguish between coughs and other noises in a sleep environment (25).  

Based  on  the  features  extracted  in  our  previous  work,  this  study  would  provide insights on variation of the peak energy features on the RMSE envelope of cough sounds. By extracting and scrutinizing the peak properties of energy  contours like peak height, peak prominence, base distance (distance between left and right base of a peak), the study aims to unveil  intricate  details  pertaining  to  cough  patterns  associated  with  diverse  respiratory diseases. The study also aims to create a strong framework for measuring and distinguishing cough patterns by combining these peak energy features and examining their correlation with various pathological conditions.** 

**Materials and methods** 

1. **Cough dataset** 

The dataset used in this study was collected from CMC (Christian Medical College), Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India as part of a clinical study. The objective of the study is to validate Swaasa.AI platform for screening and diagnosis of respiratory diseases based on audiometric evaluation of respiratory sounds (coughs and adventitious sounds) using machine learning algorithm.  The  study  was  registered  under  Clinical  Trials  Registry-  India (CTRI/2021/04/032742),  and  was  begun  after  getting  the  approval  from  the  CMC-  IRB (Institutional  Review Board).  The validation study  cohort consisted of male and female patients 18 and above years of age who presented with symptoms like cough, sore throat, fever etc, assessed through a subset of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Healthy subjects and patients with suggestive symptoms of underlying respiratory conditions were included in the study. To perform an assessment using Swaasa® AI platform, patients' demographic details and vital signs were collected, followed by interviews using the SGRQ questionnaire  to  gather  information  on  respiratory  symptoms  and  lung  health.  Trained healthcare  personnel  recorded  cough  sounds  using  smartphones,  ensuring  standardized procedures such as maintaining distance, angle, and duration. The collected cough sound samples were then subjected to noise filtering techniques, tailored to the device type. For smartphones with multiple microphones, a noise reduction algorithm based on power level

ratios resulting in automatic denoising of the audio recording is in-built. For the noisy signals, adaptive denoising technique is used to denoise the signals.  

The dataset consists of 2180 sound segments which are digital audio files in WAV format out of which 857 are normal, 746 are Asthma, and 577 are COPD. We arrived at this number by using a statistical method, Sample Size Estimation.Sample size can be estimated using statistical criteria. The formula for determining sample size is given below: 

![](Aspose.Words.863d2fbc-a34b-4b86-acd1-3de15d7fad4f.001.png)

where **Z** is the value from the standard normal distribution reflecting the confidence level that will be used, σ is the standard deviation of the outcome variable and **E** is the desired margin of error. The formula above generates the minimum number of subjects required to ensure that the margin of error in the confidence interval for μ does not exceed **E**. The feature with maximum variance is used to estimate the sample size based on the favorable error margin. Identify the feature with maximum variance for each disease type, so that we can get the sample size estimates for different diseases. For determining the estimates, we considered Z as 1.96 (95% confidence interval) and margin of error as 0.05 (5%). 

To ensure consistency all over the dataset, preprocessing of three major sound properties (Audio Channels, Sample Rate) was done. The audio channels of the cough samples were integrated into mono channels and the sample rates were modified to the default sample rate of 16000 kHz.  

2. **Acoustic analysis and Peak analysis of the Cough sound** 
1. **Acoustic Analysis** 

Acoustic analysis provides  an  objective  means  of  evaluating  the sound  characteristics  of coughs.  Investigations  into  waveforms  of  voluntary  cough  sounds  known  as, 'tussiphonograms',  indicate  the  potential  diagnostic  utility.  However,  comprehensive validation studies  for  this  purpose  are  lacking  (23).  Exploring  the  acoustic properties  of voluntary cough sounds have revealed notable distinctions among coughs associated with various diseases (24). Analyzing the waveforms which capture time and frequency content,

can help identify characteristics in cough sounds that are indicative of the presence of mucus in the airways (25,26). 

In our study, we have analyzed Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE) envelope extracted from cough sounds by quantifying the peak features.  

2. **Audio cough recording** 

Audio  cough  recordings  are  captured  using  a  smartphone  which  has  the  following specifications. 

Audio frequency range 20Hz -20kHz, Sensitivity : -26 dB to +/-2dB 

Maximum sound pressure level: 98dB - 120 dB SPL Dynamic range: 60dB. 

A cough audio recording was done, where the duration of the record was about 10 seconds (Fig 2a). It was found that the 10 second (s) cough sound had 8 cough sequences which were labeled from S1 to S8 respectively. The extrapolation of the cough sequence is shown in fig 2b, where the sequence 2 (S2) was found to have three coughs – C1, C2 and C3. In the above record for 8 sequences there are 27 coughs (this is a scenario of high cough count). The various features are extracted and analyzed from the cough sounds.

For  peak  analysis  we  have  merged  all  the  sequences  extracted  from  the  audio  cough recording and considered the first six seconds from it. 

3. **Peak Analysis** 

Peak analysis is performed on the features extracted from cough audio signals. Peak features  are  extracted  using  the  function  “scipy.signal.find\_peaks”  from  python’s  Scipy library. The peak features are obtained from peak properties and they are - 

- Peak height - Height of the peak (length). 

It is made available under a[ CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license ](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). 

- Peak prominence - The prominence of a peak measures how much a peak stands out from the surrounding baseline of the signal and is defined as the vertical distance between the peak and its lowest contour line. 
- Peak left base - The peak’s base to the left.   
- Peak right base - The peak’s base to the right.  

Features such as Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE), Zero-crossing rate (ZCR), and Spectral centroid  were  extracted  using  signal  standard  processing  techniques  in  both  time  and frequency domain. Peak analysis is performed on the envelopes of these features. 

4. **RMSE peak analysis** 

Root  Mean  Square  Energy  (RMSE)  is  a  time  domain  feature.  Peak  analysis  is performed on the RMSE envelope. A time-domain graph shows how a signal changes with time, whereas a frequency domain graph shows how much of the signal lies within each given frequency band over a range of frequencies.

**Fig 2c**-  Various peak features derived from the RMSE plot 

The prominence, height and the base distance of the peak was measured in the RMSE peak  analysis  for  normal  cough  and  different  pathological  conditions.  Fig  2c  shows  the representation of the different features of the RMSE plot for a typical cough sound. It is observed that the base distance of the peak is measured in terms of right base and left base. 

**Results** 

**1.  RMSE peak analysis for different cough sounds** 

1) *RMSE peak height analysis of female subjects* 

Fig 3 illustrates the histograms of the first RMSE peak height of the COPD (high, medium and low severity) and normal cough sound in the female subjects measured for 6s . The mean peak height of the COPD cough was found to be lower (the average mean value of the peak feature in decibels relative to full scale (dBFS) is low when compared) than the normal cough recorded for 6s. This decrease in the peak heights and decrease in prominence of the COPD cough may be attributed to the excess mucus and inflammation in the airways, destruction in the airways, resulting in less forceful expulsions of air during coughing. It was also observed that  the  severe  condition  of  COPD  exhibited  lesser  peak  heights  when  compared  to  the medium and low severe conditions. This connotes the stage of advanced COPD where the respiratory function is significantly compromised.

The RMSE peak analysis of the COPD cough and normal cough of the male subjects is depicted in Fig 4. The peak heights of the COPD and the normal cough sound recorded for 6s was observed to have a similar pattern to that of the female subjects. Another interesting finding was that, the COPD cough of the male subjects displayed more data points for lesser peak heights when compared to the COPD cough of the female subjects.

In Table 1 we have captured base distances of different respiratory diseases. In Asthma due to airways constriction cough is produced with high energy and base distance (right base – left base) is very high because of prolonged expulsion. 

COPD is a condition of inflammation/obstruction  of airways; destruction of lung tissue/alveoli. Cough is prolonged and emerges as a reaction to clear the fluid (mucus), base distance is low due to dynamic narrowing of the glottis.  

Bronchiectasis is a condition where  inflammation permanently destroys the bronchial walls  causing them to widen. The abnormally dilated bronchi filled with excess mucus, which can trigger persistent coughing and make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. Bronchiectasis also has high base distance but less when compared with asthma. 

Normal **c**ough emerges as a defense mechanism; as the site of the irritant is mostly in large airways, pressure built inside is high, Energy of the cough is also high, base distance is less. 

4) Comparison of peak analysis in different respiratory diseases 

To  understand  the  relation  between  peak  features  and  the  respiratory  diseases  we  have performed correlation between peak features of coughs  and spirometry parameters FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC. The coughs were collected from the subjects who took the spirometry

test. The coughs were mapped to spirometry reports from which spirometry parameters were collected. 

The p-value from the correlation matrix helps to understand the statistical significance of the data points. In a nutshell, if p-value is <= .05, the null hypothesis is rejected, which implies the data is indeed correlated. If a p-value is less than 0.05 it means that the test of hypothesis is significant and in our interpretation we used stars to flag levels of significance. If a p-value is less than 0.05, it is flagged with one star (\*). If a p-value is less than 0.01, it is flagged with 2 stars (\*\*). If a p-value is less than 0.001, it is flagged with three stars (\*\*\*). 

- The peak features of the normal cough, peak height and peak prominence flagged with (\*\*\*) for the spirometry parameters FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC. 
- The peak features of the obstructive patterned cough, peak position; peak left base and right base flagged with (\*) for the spirometry parameters FEV1, FVC. 
- The peak features of the restrictive patterned cough, peak position; peak left base and right base flagged with (\*\*) for the spirometry parameter FEV1/ FVC. 

The below table illustrates the comparison of peak height and base distance of coughs in different respiratory diseases with the help of box plots.

The findings underscore the potential of RMSE peak analysis in discerning between the  normal  and  pathological  conditions  and  distinguishing  the  severity  of  respiratory conditions. Analyzing both the male and female subjects in detail contributes to a holistic understanding  of  the  variation  of  acoustic  features  across  diverse  demographics  and respiratory conditions. Moreover, the exploration of peak height, peak prominence, and base distance  as  distinctive  parameters  for  characterizing  cough  patterns  provides  nuanced understanding of the acoustic signatures associated with various respiratory conditions. 

Additionally, the combination of spectrogram analysis and RMSE peak analysis also offers a multi-faceted approach to characterizing cough sounds.The correlation of the peak energy features with respiratory conditions may open avenues for more precise diagnostic tools and monitoring systems.  

Thus,  the  findings  of  the study  presented  herein  might  contribute  to  the  ongoing efforts  to  enhance  diagnostic  capabilities,  fostering  a  new  phase  in  the  assessment  and management  of  respiratory  health.  Our  future studies  might  aim  in  the  addition  of  peak analysis to ML models to increase its accuracy in cough detection and thereby to explore the correlation between acoustic features and clinical parameters, enhancing the applicability of our findings in healthcare settings. 

**Limitations** 

One  notable  limitation  of  the  study  is  the  impediment  encountered  during  peak analysis,  primarily  attributed  to  the  presence  of  noise  in  the  data,  that  might  introduce complexity in accurately isolating and characterizing peak energy features.  

**Conclusion** 

In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of cough sounds through spectrogram and RMSE peak analysis provides a novel foundation for the development of diagnostic tools for respiratory conditions, particularly COPD. The study also contributes valuable insights into the peak energy analysis of  the acoustic characteristics of cough sounds, showcasing the potential for acoustic analysis as a non-invasive and informative tool in the assessment of respiratory health and improving clinical diagnostics.
