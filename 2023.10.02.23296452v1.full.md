**Abstract** 

Analysing cough sounds is vital in pulmonary medicine. Recently, AI tools are being trained 

to analyse the acoustic signals of cough sounds so that more cases can be quickly tested, thereby reducing the patient load on primary healthcare systems. In this paper, we evaluate ”Swaasa”, our AI-based platform for rapid respiratory screening, highlighting its efficacy and ease of use. We applied our trained classifier to catch underlying pathologies from cough sound  data  collected  from  diverse  sources.  We  then  used  a  pattern  classifier  to  identify specific respiratory conditions based on cough sound patterns. We tested the robustness of our methods by comparing our results with that of a pulmonary physician in 355 cases and show that Swaasa correctly predicted associated risk in 87.32% of those cases. Our platform has a sensitivity of 97.27% with a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 88.54%, giving us the potential to revolutionise disease screening, especially for large populations and in isolated rural  areas.  Our  rapid  and  easy-to-use  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS)  solution  efficiently diagnoses  and  conserves  resources,  improves  patient  outcomes,  and  establishes  a comprehensive and accessible healthcare framework.  

**Introduction** 

A cough is a reflex action that clears the respiratory passages of excessive mucus, foreign particles,  or  other irritants [1]. It is a  common symptom of many  respiratory conditions, including  the  common  cold,  influenza,  pneumonia,  asthma,  and  chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [2, 3]. Coughs can vary in duration, frequency, and intensity, and these  variations  can  provide  important  information  about  the  underlying  condition  [4]. Different types of coughs can be linked to different respiratory conditions. For example, a dry, hacking cough may be a symptom of a viral infection such as the common cold, while a wet cough that produces a lot of mucus may be a symptom of a bacterial infection or COPD. Coughs that are accompanied by wheezing or shortness of breath may indicate asthma [5].

Medical diagnostics of respiratory pathology involve a combination of history, examination using a stethoscope, spirometry or pulmonary function testing and imaging including chest X-ray, CT of the thorax and bronchoscopy. However, this is a resource intensive process which relies on appropriate infrastructure that may not be present in resource limited settings - this can prove difficult in diagnosing respiratory diseases [7, 8]. Hence there is a need for inexpensive  and  accessible  remote  pre-screening  tools  that  can  quickly  and  accurately identify  cases  of  respiratory  disorders,  particularly  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries where  resources  are  limited.  A  remote  screening  tool  could  include  portable  diagnostic devices,  telemedicine,  or  mobile  health  (mHealth)  applications  that  can  be  used  in  the community or at the point-of-care [13, 14]. In the era of Artificial intelligence (AI), the use of cough sound analysis as a pre-screening tool for respiratory health has gained significant attention [15]. AI-powered algorithms can be trained on large datasets of cough sounds to identify patterns and characteristics associated with  specific  respiratory  conditions,  such  as  tuberculosis  (TB),  COVID-19,  asthma,  and COPD  [16–18].  These  algorithms  can  be  integrated  into  portable  diagnostic  devices  or mobile  health  (mHealth)  applications,  allowing  for  real-time  screening  of  respiratory disorders in the community or at the point-of-care. There is a significant amount of research on using the characteristics of cough sounds for objective clinical assessment. A recently conducted double-blind, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study evaluated the performance of the algorithm by comparing it to expert clinical opinion and standard lung function testing. The accuracy of the algorithm in identifying asthma exacerbations, as measured by positive percent  agreement  with  expert  clinical  diagnosis  was  89%  [19].  There  are  commercial devices available, such  as the  VitaloJAK  Cough  monitoring  device and  NuvoAir,  which objectively measure cough by counting cough events automatically. These devices can be used  to  aid  in  the  diagnosis  of  various  diseases,  including  COPD  and  asthma  [20,  21].

However, the main drawback of both these devices is the small sample size, which can limit the accuracy of the model. Additionally, relying on open-source data can also be a limitation, as the data may not be representative of the population or diverse enough to generalize to different patients. Although AI-based analysis of cough sounds is an innovative approach that has the potential to be an effective mass pre-screening tool for respiratory diseases, there remains a need for further research to validate the findings and improve the performance of the models. 

In this study, we employed the "Swaasa" AI platform to analyse cough sounds and ascertain the presence or absence of underlying disease conditions, categorized as "Risk Yes" or "Risk No."  Additionally,  we  investigated  cough  sound  patterns  to  identify  specific  respiratory conditions, including normal patterns as well as those indicative of obstructive, restrictive, and mixed pathologies. The platform underwent training using data obtained from diverse subjects in multiple previous clinical trials, ensuring a substantial level of reliability and accuracy. Stringent measures were implemented to ensure data quality, resulting in a dataset devoid of noise and encompassing cough recordings from a diverse group of individuals. In contrast to conventional approaches, our methodology employed two parallel models. The first  model  utilized  a  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN)  trained  on  Mel-frequency cepstrum (MFCC) spectrograms of cough sounds. The second model utilized primary and secondary features in a Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (FFANN). This dual-model approach allowed for comprehensive analysis, leveraging the spectral information captured by  the  CNN  model  and the  wider  range  of  primary  and secondary  features used by  the FFANN model. To further optimize the analysis, the final layers of these two models were merged, enabling the integration of their outputs and providing a more thorough and accurate assessment of the cough data. This fusion of models (combined logic) enhances the overall prediction capability of the platform [22]. To evaluate its effectiveness and feasibility a cross-

sectional pilot study was conducted on 355 subjects at Simhachalam Rural Healthcare Centre (RHC). Upon comparing the results obtained from the Swaasa platform with the physician reports, the model had a sensitivity of 93.88% and a specificity of 75.48% when identifying underlying  pathological  conditions.  Additionally,  it  was  found  to  be  87.32%  accurate  in predicting the associated risk when compared to physician reports. Furthermore, there was a significant concordance between the respiratory disease pattern predicted by pulmonologists and the outcomes provided by Swaasa. The interrater variability, quantified by the Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ=0.607), indicated a notable level of agreement among the raters.  

The results obtained from Swaasa platform are highly promising, with the potential for it to be used for quick, cost-effective, and non-invasive pre-screening of respiratory health on a large scale. Further research is needed to make it more reliable for screening diverse subjects in different environmental conditions. 

**Materials and Methods**  

**Data Collection** 

The  cough  data  was  collected  at  multiple  sites,  including  Andhra  Medical  College, Visakhapatnam,  India.  The  studies  were  registered  under  Clinical  Trials  Registry-  India (CTRI/2021/07/035096), (CTRI/2021/09/036489) and (CTRI/2021/09/036609) were begun after  getting  the  approval  from  the  AMC-  Institutional  Ethics  Committee  (IEC).   The validation study cohort consisted of male and female patients above 18 years of age who presented with cough symptoms, assessed through a subset of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire  (SGRQ).  Patients  with  suggestive  symptoms  of  underlying  respiratory conditions were included in the study. To evaluate the model, patients' demographic details and  vital  signs  were  collected,  followed by  interviews  using the  SGRQ  questionnaire  to gather information on respiratory symptoms and lung health. Trained healthcare personnel recorded  cough  sounds  using  smartphones,  ensuring  standardized  procedures  such  as

maintaining distance, angle,  and duration. The collected cough sound samples were then subjected to noise filtering techniques, tailored to the device  type. For  smartphones  with multiple microphones, a noise reduction algorithm based on power level ratios was applied, resulting in denoised audio  recordings. For  smartphones  with a single microphone, noise removal techniques during pre-processing were employed to isolate the cough signal using Fast  Fourier  Transform.  Valid  coughs  were  detected  using  a  cough/non-cough  classifier, ensuring the inclusion of reliable data in the analysis. Safety measures were implemented during the recording process, including the use of surgical masks by subjects and sanitization of recording devices after each use. Additionally, reference standard tests, namely spirometry and chest X-ray examinations, were conducted to establish a clinical diagnosis. By comparing the  model's  results  with  the  clinical  diagnosis  based  on  the  reference standard  tests,  the model's performance in accurately assessing lung health and identifying specific respiratory conditions was evaluated. 

**Model building** 

The collected cough data has been used to build and validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the model in screening respiratory conditions. The model's architecture and functionalities were built incrementally as the research progressed. The audio recordings underwent rigorous processing and extraction procedures to isolate individual cough events. This involved careful removal of confounding factors, such as speech, background noise, and other respiratory sounds, to ensure the purity of the cough data. For the development of the Cough non-cough classifier, a dataset comprising cough sequences and non-cough sequences from a diverse population  was utilized.  The classifier  was  trained  using  machine  learning  techniques  to differentiate  between cough and non-cough sounds accurately.  This dataset was carefully curated to encompass various scenarios encountered in real-world settings. The risk classifier, responsible for determining the presence of underlying respiratory problems, was trained on a

separate  dataset.  It  consisted  of  cough  sequences  labelled  as  Risk  'Yes'  (indicative  of obstructive, restrictive, mixed, and other pathologies) and cough sequences labelled as Risk 'No' (representing normal conditions). This dataset allowed the classifier to learn patterns and characteristics  in  the  cough  sounds  associated  with  specific  respiratory  conditions.  To identify respiratory disease patterns, a pattern classifier was developed using a combined logic  approach.  This  classifier  integrated  a  CNN  and  a  FFANN  model  to  automatically classify different types of respiratory diseases based on the signature patterns present in the cough  data  [22].  The  classifier  was  trained  on  a  dataset  ensuring  consistency  and generalizability of the results. Throughout the development process, careful attention was given to the scientific rigor and reproducibility of the platform. The datasets used for training and validation were extensively validated and cross-validated to ensure the reliability of the classifiers. Additionally, the performance metrics of the classifiers were rigorously evaluated using appropriate statistical measures.  

**Safety and Usability assessment**  

In the current study, we employed various methods to assess the usability and efficacy of the model  for  respiratory  health  assessment  in  a  primary  healthcare  setting.  The  evaluation included Critical Task Analysis and a Questionnaire survey. Critical Task Analysis focused on analysing the user interface elements, while the Questionnaire survey aimed to assess user satisfaction. Our participant pool consisted of two health workers from a primary healthcare center and a qualified healthcare practitioner. 

**Performance validation of model** 

Clinical validation was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the device when deployed as a screening tool prior to diagnosis. We enrolled 400 subjects from a peripheral health care centre, RHC Simhachalam. Figure 1 shows the age and gender distribution of the recruited

subjects. Cough data from 45 subjects was inconclusive, hence considered data collected from 355 subjects only for the study. 

**Data analysis**  

A summary sheet was created by a statistician that includes the clinical diagnosis and the results from Swaasa platform. This sheet was used to compare the results against the gold standard, which is the diagnosis made by a physician. The physicians were not made aware of the  results  from  the  Swaasa  system.  The  effectiveness  of  the  model  was  determined  by calculating the ratio of patients who were correctly diagnosed as positive to the total number of patients who had positive results by Swaasa. 

**Statistical analysis** 

The comprehensive evaluation of the model performance on the test set includes accuracy sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV) and ROC. To measure the variability around these parameters, we used 95% confidence intervals using the Clopper–Pearson method [23]. We also used kappa (κ) statistic to test interrater reliability to better understand the performance of the model in predicting the respiratory disease pattern with respect to the Physician’s report. 

**Results** 

**Model Output in the Clinical Validation**  

1) **Risk Classifier** 

   ` `In the study, 355 individuals were screened, and the risk classifier successfully identified 286 individuals  with  potential  respiratory  disorders  (Table  1).  This  resulted  in  an  impressive positive predictive value of 88.54%. 

   Furthermore, the sensitivity of the risk classifier was determined to be 97.27%. This means that the system was able to accurately detect a large proportion of individuals with respiratory

disorders, minimizing the chances of false negatives. On the other hand, the accuracy of the risk classifier was found to be 87.32% (Table 2). While not as high as the sensitivity, the accuracy still indicates that the system can reliably identify individuals without respiratory disorders, reducing false positives. The risk classifier's accuracy and reliability make it an invaluable tool  for early detection  and intervention. By  identifying individuals at risk of respiratory disorders, healthcare professionals can initiate timely interventions, leading  to improved patient outcomes. The high positive predictive value and sensitivity of the risk classifier make it an effective screening tool for identifying individuals who require further diagnostic testing and medical attention.** 

2) **Pattern  Classifier:**  Model's  pattern  classifier  is  designed  to  categorize  individuals  into different respiratory health patterns, providing valuable insights into their lung function and airflow  patterns.  The  classifier  successfully  categorizes  individuals  into  four  distinct categories: "Normal," "Obstructive," "Restrictive," and "Mixed."** A "Normal" classification indicates  a  healthy  respiratory  system  with  no  significant  abnormalities  detected  in  lung function or airflow patterns. An "Obstructive" classification suggests the presence of airway blockage,  which  can  be  indicative  of  conditions  such  as  asthma  or  chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A "Restrictive" classification points to a decrease in the lung's ability to expand fully, which may be caused by conditions like pulmonary fibrosis or chest wall deformities. Lastly, a "Mixed" classification suggests a combination of both obstructive and restrictive patterns (Table 3). 

   To validate the accuracy and consistency of the pattern classifier, a comparison was made between the classifier's predictions and the assessments made by pulmonologists. The study found  a  moderate  level  of  agreement  (κ  =  0.607)  between  the  predictions  of  the pulmonologists and the outcomes generated by the Swaasa system (Table 4). This level of agreement  signifies  that  the  pattern  classifier's  categorizations  align  closely  with  the

assessments  made  by  experts  in  the  field,  further  validating  the  system's  accuracy  and reliability.** 

The  pattern  classifier's  ability  to  categorize  individuals  into  different  respiratory  health patterns allows for targeted treatment and management plans. By understanding the specific pattern exhibited by an individual, healthcare professionals can tailor interventions to address the underlying condition effectively. This personalized approach improves the quality of care and  outcomes  for  patients  with  respiratory  disorders.**  Overall,  Model's  pattern  classifier provides  valuable  insights  into  an  individual's  respiratory  health,  categorizing  them  into distinct patterns that aid in diagnosis and treatment planning. The agreement between the system's predictions and those of pulmonologists validates its accuracy, while its simplicity and accessibility make it a practical tool for healthcare providers to incorporate into their respiratory health screenings.** 

**Model feasibility study** 

The evaluation of the model yielded important results regarding safety and usability. In terms of safety, potential hazards and failure modes associated with the platform were identified, such as the absence of standard cough recording protocols, adverse effects for specific patient conditions, background noise during audio recording, and inadequate precautions for device cleaning.  Control  measures  were  implemented,  and  safety  guidelines  were  followed  to mitigate these risks. Regarding usability, the Critical Task Analysis demonstrated that users were generally able to complete critical tasks successfully. However, some issues related to screen navigation and session expiry were identified. The Questionnaire survey indicated that users  found  the  device  interface  pleasant,  easy  to  learn,  and  consistent.  Areas  for improvement  were  identified,  such  as  expanding  the  coverage  of  error  messages  in  the instructions for use (IFU) and addressing occasional app stability issues. Based on the study

findings, several suggestions for improvement were compiled, including enhancing screen navigation, addressing session expiry issues, expanding the coverage of error messages in the IFU,  and  resolving  occasional  app  stability  issues.  Overall,  the  participants  expressed satisfaction with the simplicity and ease of use of the device. In conclusion, our feasibility study  confirms  the usability and safety of the Swaasa  AI  platform  for  respiratory health assessment  in  a  primary  healthcare  setting.  The  study  findings  have  provided  valuable insights and recommendations for further enhancing the device's usability and effectiveness. 

**Discussion** 

Machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize the way respiratory diseases are detected and diagnosed. By combining cough sound analysis with computed tomography (CT) and chest radiography (CXR), ML algorithms can efficiently detect a wide range of conditions, including COVID-19 [24, 25]. 

Such methods have already been used in the past to diagnose and predict the outcome of conditions such as lung cancer, bronchitis, pneumonia, COPD, TB and asthma [5, 17, 26–31]. AI has the potential to improve respiratory health by providing faster and more accurate diagnoses. AI algorithms can analyse large data sets to identify patterns and trends that help in developing new treatment methods. Our contribution to the State of the art is the Swaasa AI platform that combines the final output layers of two separate models - a tabular model that uses the primary and secondary features as input and a CNN model that used MFCC spectrograms  as  input.  This  approach  resulted  in  significantly  better  predictions  than previously used logistic regression or a CNN model alone [17, 30, 31].  

In our cross-sectional feasibility study, we evaluated the usability and efficacy of "Swaasa" for rapid respiratory health assessment. The study specifically focused on analysing cough patterns  and using  risk classifiers to assess respiratory health. The  risk classifier,  trained using cough data, accurately determines the risk of respiratory disorders, classifying it as

"Yes" or "No." This allows for early identification of individuals who may require further evaluation  and  medical  intervention.  The  pattern  classifier,  also  trained  on  cough  data, categorizes coughs into three types: obstructive, restrictive, and mixed, providing valuable insights  into  the  underlying  respiratory  conditions.  Together,  these  classifiers  enable  a comprehensive  assessment  of  respiratory  health,  facilitating  timely  interventions  and personalized treatment plans. Also, the clinical validation was conducted on a relatively large cohort,  whereas  previous  studies  were  carried  out  on  smaller  scales  or  using  unreliable crowdsource datasets [17, 30, 32]. This approach provided a more robust and reliable dataset for evaluation. 

Model’s risk classifier plays a crucial role in identifying individuals at risk of respiratory disorders. By analysing cough patterns, the platform accurately determines the likelihood of respiratory issues, such as obstructive, restrictive, and mixed conditions. The study revealed that the risk classifier of the Swaasa platform achieved a sensitivity of 97.27%, indicating its high capability in correctly identifying individuals who are at risk. This sensitivity implies that the risk classifier has a low rate of false negatives, effectively detecting a significant proportion of individuals with potential respiratory disorders. The accurate identification of at-risk individuals enables timely interventions and targeted healthcare strategies to improve their overall respiratory health outcomes. The results of the assessments obtained using the model  were  found to  be highly  correlated  with  those  obtained  from  traditional  methods, indicating that the platform can accurately assess respiratory health. The results of the study also  showed  that  the  predictions  made  by  pulmonologists  regarding  respiratory  disease patterns  matched  well  with  the  outcomes  generated  by  the  Swaasa  system.  This  was demonstrated by a moderate level of agreement, as measured by the interrater variability value  (κ  =  0.607).  This  indicates  that  the  predictions  made  by  pulmonologists  and  the

outcomes generated by Swaasa system were consistent, which is important validation of the accuracy and reliability of the system. 

The  present  study  establishes  the  feasibility  and  safety  of  implementing  the  Swaasa  AI platform  for  respiratory  health  assessment  in  primary  healthcare  settings.  Through  a comprehensive  evaluation  involving  Critical  Task  Analysis  and  a  Questionnaire  survey, valuable  insights  were  gained  regarding  the  platform's  usability  and  efficacy.  The  study identified  important  safety  considerations,  including  the  need  for  standardized  cough recording protocols, mitigation of potential adverse effects, management of background noise during  audio  recording,  and  implementation  of  appropriate  device  cleaning  procedures. Usability enhancements were recommended, particularly in addressing screen navigation and session expiry issues. Additionally, the study highlighted the high level of user satisfaction, with participants expressing positive feedback regarding the platform's simplicity, ease of use, and consistency. These findings reinforce the potential of the Swaasa AI platform as a valuable tool for respiratory health assessment in primary healthcare, while also providing valuable guidance for further refinement and optimization. 

In conclusion, the model demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of utilizing cough patterns and risk classifiers for rapid respiratory health assessment. Its potential applications extend to primary care clinics, hospitals, and remote locations, where it can significantly enhance the speed and accuracy of respiratory health evaluations. Furthermore, the platform serves as a valuable  triage  tool,  enabling  the  identification  of  high-risk  patients  and  optimizing  the allocation of clinical resources for improved patient outcomes. 

To  ensure  the  generalizability  of  the  Swaasa  platform,  future  studies  will  involve  mass screening of subjects from diverse populations, languages, and cultures. This approach will validate  its  effectiveness  and  applicability  across  various  settings  globally.  Additionally, efforts  will  be  made  to  diversify  the  training  data  set,  incorporating  a  wider  range  of

respiratory  conditions  and  demographics,  further  enhancing  the  platform's  accuracy  and reliability. 

Safety  and  usability  considerations  are  integral  to  the  continuous  development  and implementation  of  the  model.  Strict  adherence  to  safety  guidelines,  including  the standardization  of  cough  recording  protocols,  mitigation  of  potential  adverse  effects, management of background noise, and appropriate device cleaning procedures, ensures the safety of both patients and healthcare providers. Ongoing refinements will address usability aspects  such  as  screen  navigation  and  session  expiry  issues,  aiming  to  optimize  user experience and facilitate seamless integration of the platform into routine clinical practice. Overall,  the  model  demonstrates  promise  as  an  efficient  and  reliable  screening  tool  for respiratory health assessment, with future advancements and validations anticipated to further establish its utility in diverse healthcare settings.
